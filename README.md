### Serial communication between STM32 and Desktop application 

Real-time remote configuration of STM32 peripherals via desktop application 

## Key points 

- Desktop application developed in Qt C++
- Comprehensive control of STM32 peripherals: UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, DAC, timers, GPIO Input, Output
- Efficient communication via UART protocol with STM32H723 microcontroller
- Generic, reconfigurable, and modifiable codebase on STM32 to customize device behavior to meet application needs

## Additional information:

- This project was developed using Qt C++ and the STM32Cube HAL library.
- The application is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for developers to configure STM32 peripherals in real time.

## Benefits of XCube:

- Flexibility: XCube allows users to select, activate, deactivate, and reload peripheral configurations in real time, without the need to recompile or reprogram the device.
- Efficiency: XCube communicates with the STM32 microcontroller efficiently via the UART protocol, minimizing latency and overhead.
- Customization: XCube provides users with a generic, reconfigurable, and modifiable codebase on the STM32, empowering them to tailor the device's behavior to suit specific application requirements.
